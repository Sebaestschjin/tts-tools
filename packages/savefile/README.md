# TTS Tools - Save file

This module splits a save file from Tabletop Simulator into multiple files.
It can also embed the split files again to create an updated save file while also updating the Lua and XML scripts.

Checkout [the documentation](https://sebaestschjin.github.io/tts-tools/savefile/latest/index.html) for how to use it.

This module is also available as a [command line tool](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@tts-tools/cli).
