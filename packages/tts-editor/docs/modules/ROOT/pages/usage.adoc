= Usage

[#workspace]
In order for the extension to work, you need to open at least one folder in VS Code.
This is called the workspace directory in this documentation.
If you are using a multi-directory workspace (by opening multiple root directories at once in VS Code), only the very first directory will be considered as the workspace directory.

[#output]
The so-called output directory is a special directory inside the workspace directory.
This is where the extension will keep the files it read from TTS to work with.
The output directory is a directory called `.tts` inside the workspace directory.
The extension will write the script files from TTS to this directory for each object.
You can navigate this directory directly, or use the xref:view.adoc[] in the explorer window to get a cleaner view of the objects with more functionalities.

Edit the scripts for the objects you want (either by opening from the output directory or the object view) and save the files.
Then execute the command "Save and Play".
The default keybinding for this command is kbd:ctrl[alt+s].
You can bind it to any other keys you like, through the settings in VS Code.
Alternatively, there's also a three dot menu button in the object view, where you can execute the command from.

Using "Save and Play" will send all script files that are currently in your output directory back to TTS to update them on their respective objects.
When a file was deleted in the output directory, the script will be removed from the object.
When a file was added (e.g. adding an XML UI file), it will also be added to the object in TTS.

[IMPORTANT]
====
"Save and Play" will load the save you loaded in TTS before applying scripts.
This means, every change you performed after loading the save in TTS will be reverted, like adding new objects, moving objects, deleting objects, etc.

So whenever you make physical changes in your loaded save file, first save it and load it right again, before using "Save and Play".
Otherwise, you will lose the changes.
====

While using "Save and Play" scripts on objects that use `require` and XML UI that uses `<Include/ >` will be updated by reading the latest version of those scripts from the file system.
Checkout the xref:bundling.adoc[bundling documentation] for details about that process.

Using the right-click context menu menu:Scripting[Scripting Edtior] on an object in TTS, will create a Lua script in the output directory of the extension and open the newly created file.

You can execute Lua scripts that you have opened in VS Code via the "Execute Code" command.
Checkout the xref:execute.adoc[documentation] for details.
