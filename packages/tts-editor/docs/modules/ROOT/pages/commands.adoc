[#object-selection]
== Object selection

Commands that are used for objects can also be executed without an object context, e.g. from the command palette in VS Code.
In this case, before executing the command a selection dialog will show up, where one of the currently loaded objects can be selected.
The command will then be executed as if the object was selected from the xref:view.adoc[] directly.

.Example object selection dialog

An object context is available, when using the context menus and buttons in the xref:view.adoc[].
In this case the selection dialog is skipped and the object from the view is used directly.

|===
| Name | Usage

| Get Objects
| Get the scripts of all objects currently on the table (including `Global`).
Scripts are unbundled while doing so, but a bundled reference is kept as well (see xref:bundling.adoc[]).
This command is also automatically executed whenever you load a new game in TTS.

| Save and Play
| (see xref:bundling.adoc[]).

| Save and Play (Bundled)
| Like "Save and Play" but instead of using the scripts from the output directory, the scripts from the bundled output directory will be used.
No extra bundling step is performed and the scripts are taken as is.
This can be useful when working on mods where the source files are not available to proper bundle them.

| Execute Code
| Executes the current editor content as a Lua script in TTS.
See xref:execute.adoc[] for details.

| Get Runtime UI
| Read the current XML UI of the selected object from TTS, write it to a file and open it.
The current XML UI is determined by calling `UI.getXml()` on the selected object.
Also shows up as an action button in the xref:view.adoc[].

| Get Object State
[[get-state]]|
Read the current script state of the selected object from TTS, write it to a file and open it.
The current script state is read from the `script_state` field of the selected object.
For `Global`, the `onSave` method is called instead.
Also shows up as an action button in the xref:view.adoc[].

| Update Object State
| Only shows up, when a file created from <<get-state,Get Object State>> is opened.
It will send this file to TTS, update the corresponding object script state and reload the object.

| Update Object
| Destroys the selected object in TTS and spawns a new instance based on the current object data in the xref:terms.adoc[output directory].
Before doing so, the scripts inside the object data are bundled.
This includes nested object of the selected object is a container.

| Locate Object
| Highlights the selected object in TTS by randomly applying a different color over a certain time period.
Will also trigger a player ping on the object.
