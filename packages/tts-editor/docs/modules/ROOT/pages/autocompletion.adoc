= Auto-completion

The extension doesn't add any auto-completion on its own for the TTS API.
However, it's possible to add that via the https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=sumneko.lua[Lua extension] for VS Code.
Since this a dedicated extension for handling Lua, it is far superior to whatever auto-completion this extension could provide, and it has also active support.

== Setup
* Install the https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=sumneko.lua[Lua extension] in VS Code.
* Download the file `language-server.zip` from the latest https://github.com/Sebaestschjin/typed-tabletop-simulator/releases[release] and extract it somewhere at your local file system.
* Open the settings in VS Code and search for `lua library`.
Add a new item for this setting and add the path in your local file system where your extracted the file from before.

== Usage

After setup, you can use VS Code's auto-completion features to type function names and get possible functions to use, including some documentation about what the function does and what kind of parameters it requires.

It will also include your own written functions.

The same then also applies for returned values from function calls.
E.g. when a function returns an object reference, you get possible functions you can call on this reference.s

And also function parameters.
E.g. in this example it lists the possible parameters to the `createButton` function and also denotes whether the argument is optional (with a `?`) or required.

The extension offers many more features to help you improve your code and coding experience, e.g. by offering diagnostics or a formatter.
