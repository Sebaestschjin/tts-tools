This will also automatically happen, once you load a new game in TTS.

You will notice a new directory called `.tts` inside the directory you opened.
This is where the extension keeps the scripts it got from TTS.
You don't need to interact with this directory directly, but you can.

An easier way to interact with those files might be to use the TTS Objects view (see next step).
