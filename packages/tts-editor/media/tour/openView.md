This view gives you an overview of all the objects that currently have scripts on the table.
Expand each object to see which scripts the objects have attached.
Clicking on the script (e.g. `Script` or `UI`) will open the script file.

Clicking on the icon that shows when you hover a script entry, you can open the bundled version of the script.
