# TTS Tools - Command Line Interface

This command line tool splits a save file from Tabletop Simulator into multiple files.
It can also embed the split files again to create an updated save file while also updating the Lua and XML scripts.

Checkout [the documentation](https://sebaestschjin.github.io/tts-tools/savefile/latest/cli.html) for how to use it.

This tool is also available as a [library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@tts-tools/savefile).
