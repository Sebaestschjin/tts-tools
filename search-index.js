reads the directory of a previously extracted save file and recreates it again. While doing so, it will also bundle the scripts and XML files of all objects again (even the ones inside containers) from a given include path. Changing data before embedding is also possible. To change the object’s data (e.g. it’s tags or nickname), simply edit it’s Data.json. In case of changing the nickname or GUID of the object, renaming the directory to mimic this change is not required. This would automatically happen once you extract the embedded save file again. To change the script, XML UI or script state, simply edit the respective Script.ttslua, UI.xml or State.txt file. Deleting those file will remove the script/XML UI /script state for this object. To add contents into a container you have to do two things: Add all relevant files into the contents directory of the container. Add an entry to the Contents.json of the container and point to the directory of the added object. To remove content from a container, remove its entry from the Contents.json file. After extracting the embedded save file, the object’s directory will also be removed. The Contents.json also contains the order of elements inside the container. If you want to change that order, rearrange the entries to your needs. Adding, removing states also works the same, but uses the states directory and States.json file instead. And the same applies for attachments, but uses the children directory and the Children.json file instead.

Each folder contains the information for one object (or Global). It contains different files per object, depending on what attributes it has (listed in the sections below). The files all have the same name, they are discriminated by the directory they are part of. The data from Global will be on the top level of the output directory. From there the directory Contents contains the globally available objects. Object directories are named by using their nickname (the applied name that is also visible in the TTS tooltip), followed by a dot and their GUID. If the object doesn’t have nickname, their internal name is used instead. If the object is a container (a bag or deck), it’s content is again nested inside the Contents directory.

Otherwise they will be ignored, effectively clearing the state of all objects. contentsPath string No Name of the directory for a container object or the global table where each contained object will be written to. Defaults to no name, meaning objects are extracted directly into their container directory. statesPath string No Name of the directory for an object with multiple states where each state will be written to.

When set the keys in each Data.json file will be sorted by this order. Each field not listed will be sorted alphabetically after each listed field was sorted accordinly. E.g. an object data like this: { \"GUID\": \"12356\", \"Name\": \"Custom_Token\", \"CustomImage\": { \"CustomToken\": { \"StandUp\": false, \"Stackable\": false, \"Thickness\": 0.1, \"MergeDistancePixels\": 15.0001 }, \"ImageSecondaryURL\": \"..\", \"ImageURL\": \"...\" }, \"Nickname\": \"Test\" } with a keyOrder option [\"GUID\", \"Name\", \"Nickname\", \"ImageURL\", \"ImageSecondaryURL\"], would create a Data.json file like this: { \"GUID\": \"12356\", \"Name\": \"Custom_Token\", \"Nickname\": \"Test\", \"CustomImage\": { \"ImageURL\": \"...\", \"ImageSecondaryURL\": \"..\", \"CustomToken\": { \"MergeDistancePixels\": 15.0001, \"Stackable\": false, \"StandUp\": false, \"Thickness\": 0.1 } } } The following files are created while extracting (when applicable).

This file contains the XML UI attached to the object (or Global).

This file contains the script state of the object (or Global). This file contains the data from the original save file for this object (or Global). Fields that where extracted (e.g. the Lua script or XML UI), will be empty and not included in the file. Adding contents to those fields will be ignored as their contents is solely driven by the available files for this object.

Download the file language-server.zip from the latest release and extract it somewhere at your local file system. Open the settings in VS Code and search for lua library. Add a new item for this setting and add the path in your local file system where your extracted the file from before. After setup, you can use VS Code’s auto-completion features to type function names and get possible functions to use, including some documentation about what the function does and what kind of parameters it requires. It will also include your own written functions. The same then also applies for returned values from function calls. E.g. when a function returns an object reference, you get possible functions you can call on this reference.s And also function parameters. E.g. in this example it lists the possible parameters to the createButton function and also denotes whether the argument is optional (with a ?) or required.

In this case, before executing the command a selection dialog will show up, where one of the currently loaded objects can be selected. The command will then be executed as if the object was selected from the TTS Objects View directly. Figure 1. Example object selection dialog An object context is available, when using the context menus and buttons in the TTS Objects View. In this case the selection dialog is skipped and the object from the view is used directly. Name Usage Get Objects Get the scripts of all objects currently on the table (including Global). Scripts are unbundled while doing so, but a bundled reference is kept as well (see Bundling). This command is also automatically executed whenever you load a new game in TTS.

Execute Code Executes the current editor content as a Lua script in TTS. See Execute Scripts for details. Get Runtime UI Read the current XML UI of the selected object from TTS, write it to a file and open it. The current XML UI is determined by calling UI.getXml() on the selected object. Also shows up as an action button in the TTS Objects View. Get Object State Read the current script state of the selected object from TTS, write it to a file and open it. The current script state is read from the script_state field of the selected object. For Global, the onSave method is called instead. Also shows up as an action button in the TTS Objects View. Update Object State Only shows up, when a file created from Get Object State is opened. It will send this file to TTS, update the corresponding object script state and reload the object. Update Object Destroys the selected object in TTS and spawns a new instance based on the current object data in the output directory. Before doing so, the scripts inside the object data are bundled.

It will send to current editor content to TTS and execute it as a script. The script will be executed in the context of Global. Macro functions are a feature to interact between the Lua code you want to execute and the VS Code instance where the extension is running at. E.g. you can trigger a selection dialog in VS Code where you select an object from the currently available objects on the table. Or open some text directly as an editor in VS Code instead of printing it into the output channel. This allows to write helper template files that can be more easily re-used without adjusting the template itself (e.g. by replacing the GUID of the object your want to with). In fact, many of the extension features are implemented using macro functions, e.g. locating an object or getting the runtime UI. More macros will also be added in the future. If you have an idea of a macro that might benefit you, let me know. Macros functions are only enabled when this setting is enabled (which it is by default). However, this setting can be disabled when working with unknown or untrusted mods to prevent accidentally triggering. This macro lets you trigger a selection dialog inside VS Code that shows all currently loaded objects. It takes two arguments: An option table to configure the shown selection (see below). A callback function that is executed once the selection was done in VS Code. The callback receives the object reference of the selected object as it’s only parameter. The object reference can also be Global, when configured through the options. Example __object__({ placeholder = \"Select an object to locate it\" }, function(obj) -- executed after the selection was done in TTS -- obj is now the object reference of the selected object print(obj.getName()) end) This example will trigger a selection dialog like this in VS Code. Selecting one of the objects will trigger the provided callback function in TTS with the object reference of the selected object. When the object is already destroyed after selecting it, an error message is thrown instead. When the selection is cancelled in VS Code, the callback isn’t called. The following fields can be set in the options table to adjust which objects are selectable and ho how the prompt will look like: Table 1. Fields Name Type Usage title? string An optional tile text that will be added to the top of the quick pick. placeholder? string An optional text that will be added to the text box of the quick pick (see screenshot above). withGlobal? boolean If true, Global will also be selectable in the quick pick, otherwise it will be removed. Defaults to false. This macro lets you sent text from TTS to VS Code that will either be written to a file or shown as a temporary file. It takes exactly one argument that is described below. Example __write__({ name = \"runtime.xml\", object = Global, content = Global.UI.getXml() }) This example will write a file called Global.runtime.xml into the output directory that contains the current XML of Global. Table 2. Fields Name Type Usage content string The content to write to a file/to show in the editor. name? string The name of the file to write. When not set, no file will be written. Instead, the content will be shown in a temporary editor in VS Code. The file will be written to the workspace directory. object? object reference The object the content belongs to. When set, the file will be written to the output directory for this object and name will be used as an extension instead of the complete file name. format? \"auto\" | \"none\" Determines how the content should be formatted before writing/showing it. When set to \"none\", no formatting will take place. When set ti \"auto\", the extension will try to parse the content to JSON.

Some extension features (like macro functions) are implemented through this, but they could also be used on their own. This section describes the supported messages and their format. In the tables describing the fields of a message a ? denotes and optional field. E.g. title? means there’s a field called title but it is optional and can be nil. Those messages can be sent to the extension with the sendExternalMessage function inside TTS. Each message has type field to distinguish them and fields specific to the message. Example sendExternalMessage({ type = \"object\" }) Messages sent from TTS are only handled when the respective setting is enabled. Otherwise, they are ignored. The setting is enabled by default, but it might make sense to disable it when working with unknown or untrusted mods as the messages can result in files to be written to the user’s filesystem. This message can be sent from TTS to the extension to trigger an object selection inside VS Code. The selection will show a quick pick of currently loaded objects. Picking a selection sends the Object message to TTS. Cancelling the selection doesn’t send any messages back. Figure 1. Example quick pick dialog Table 1.

Defaults to false. Example sendExternalMessage({ type = \"object\", withGlobal = true, placeholder = \"Select an object to proceed\", }) This message can be sent from TTS to request that text is shown in an editor in VS Code. Additionally, the text can also be written to a file. The content/file will also be opened in VS Code after receiving this message. Table 2. Fields Name Type Usage type \"write\" Used to distinguish different messages. content string The content to write to a file/to show in the editor. name? string The name of the file to write. When not set, no file will be written. Instead, the content will be shown in a temporary editor in VS Code.

When set to \"none\", no formatting will take place. When set ti \"auto\", the extension will try to parse the content to JSON. If it succeeds, it will pretty print it, otherwise it will leave it as is. Defaults to \"auto\". Example sendExternalMessage({ type = \"write\", content = \"Hello World\", name = \"Test.txt\", }) This will write a file called Test.txt with this content: Hello World Example sendExternalMessage({ type = \"write\", content = '{ \"this\": { \"is\": \"json\" } }', object = \"-1\", name = \"test.txt\" }) This will write a file called Global.test.txt inside the output directory with the content formatted as: { \"this\": { \"is\": \"json\" } } Example Files can not be written outside the workspace directory (e.g. by using a name like ../../test.txt). Writing a file will be ignored, if the resolved file path is not inside the workspace directory. Those messages can be handled with the onExternalMessage event inside TTS.
