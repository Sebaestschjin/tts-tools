is the command line interface for the savefile module to split and embed TTS save files. Either globally npm install -g @tts-tools/cli Or as part of another package npm install -D @tts-tools/cli Show help information or the current version: tts-save (--help|--version) Run on of the commands (see below for details): tts-save (extract|embed) [options] Show help information or the current version: tts-save extract (--help|--version) Execute the command: tts-save extract [options] Extracts the given saveFile. The ending .json for saveFile is optional. The tool will first look for the save file in the current location. If it can not be found there, it will attempt to find the file in the TTS save file directory. The TTS directory will also be searched recursively, so the file can be at any nesting level. This behavior is intended for mods where multiple people work on it and allows the developers to keep the development version of the save at any hierarchy level in the TTS save directory they desire. Which files are generated with extract, is described here. --output , -o Required. Specifies the directory where the extracted files will be written to. The directory will be created if it doesn’t exist yet. --clean, -c If set, the output directory will be deleted before extracting (if it exists). --normalize, -n If set, all floating point numbers will be rounded to the nearest 0.0001 value within the data files. Running this command: tts-save embed (--help|--version) tts-save embed --clean --normalize --output content GHE_Dev With a TTS save file directory like this: ├─ Games | ├─ TS_Save_2.json ├─ GHE | ├─ GHE_Dev.json | ├─ TS_Save_3.json ├─ TS_Save_1.json Will extract the file GHE/GHE_Dev.json from the TTS save file folder. If the TTS save file folder doesn’t contain a save file with this name somewhere, it would try to extract the file from the directory the tts-save command is called from. Show help information or the current version: tts-save embed (--help|--version) Execute the command: tts-save embed [options] Embeds a previously extracted save file and creates a new TTS save file. While doing so, all scripts that use require or UI that uses will be updated to include the latest versions for those scripts (given the correct include path). More details about the process can be found here. --output , -o Required. Defines there file name where the embedded save file will be written to. The ending .json is optional. The tool will first attempt to find a file with this name in the TTS save file directory (at any nesting). If it can find such a file, it will be overwritten with the embedded file. Otherwise, the file will be written relative to the current path. --inlcude , -i Path to Lua and XML files that are include with require() and . Can be repeated. The directories will be searched for scripts in the given order.

Install the Lua extension in VS Code. Download the file language-server.zip from the latest release and extract it somewhere at your local file system. Alternatively you could also clone linked git repository, so it’s easier to get updates on those files, if you are familiar with git. Open the settings in VS Code and search for lua library. Add a new item for this setting and add the path in your local file system where your extracted the file from before. After setup, you can use VS Code’s auto-completion features to type function names and get possible functions to use, including some documentation about what the function does and what kind of parameters it requires. It will also include your own written functions. The same then also applies for returned values from function calls. E.g. when a function returns an object reference, you get possible functions you can call on this reference.s And also function parameters. E.g. in this example it lists the possible parameters to the createButton function and also denotes whether the argument is optional (with a ?) or required. The extension offers many more features to help you improve your code and coding experience, e.g. by offering diagnostics or a formatter. Checkout its documentation for more details.

However, once a script gets bigger it also gets harder to manage and keep track of. Also, when multiple objects use the same or very similar scripts, it’s get harder to update all of them the more objects are involved or the bigger the scripts get. This is where bundling of scripts is helpful as it allows to split scripts into multiple files that can be re-used by multiple objects or even by different scripts files on the same object. Splitting scripts into different individual components is a very basic and important part of software development. It allows to split a codebase into different functional components where each component (aka module) has its own responsibility that is separated from other responsibilities. E.g. a library to work with tables, another one to work with strings, one module that does the game setup and another one that keeps track of the game state or similar. When those are separated it’s easier to reason about them individually, define clear contracts between each part (aka interfaces) and thus makes it easier to develop each part further individually. E.g. consider you have a utility function somewhere, that allows to filter out elements of a table that you use often in your scripts. Something like this: local function filter(tab, predicate) local newTable = {} for _, v in ipairs(tab) do if predicate(v) then table.insert(newTable, v) end end return newTable end Without bundling, whenever you want to use this function on one of your objects, you’d have to copy it over to use it. If you want to add new features to it, or fix a nasty bug, you’d have to do that for every copy for function on all objects. This gets annoying, time-consuming and error-prone very fast. Instead, you can split this function (and probably other functions related to working with tables), into a separate file. For this example the file will be called TableUtil.lua and is in a directory called lib in the workspace directory. The script from the example needs a small adjustment, so it’s easier to work with it later on. local TableUtil = {} function TableUtil.filter(tab, predicate) -- the code from the example before end return TableUtil Now you can include it in your script by writing require(\"path.to.file\") where path.to.file is the path to the .lua file inside the workspace directory, so in this example it would be \"lib.TableUtil\". Each directory is separated by a dot and the .lua extension must be left out. A usage could look like this: Some object script local TableUtil = require(\"lib.TableUtil\") TableUtil.filter({ \"a\", \"b\", \"a\" }, function(v) return v == \"a\" end) Instead of copying the script, it’s now instead read from the \"lib.TableUtil.lua\" file. The return value from this file is returned by the require call and can then be bound to the local TableUtil parameter that is used. Accessing the function is then done by accessing the TableUtil variable, to call it. You can require as many files as you need or want. And files that are required can also require other files as well. By using require you can make it clear what dependencies a file has. Once you update a required files it’s updated in all the places where it’s used without manually editing all those places. It isn’t technically required to use a return value in your required files. You can also use global variables to achieve the same effect, e.g. like this: -- The lib.TableUtil file TableUtil = {} TableUtil.filter = function(tab, predicate) -- the code from the example before end -- another file require(\"lib.TableUtil\") TableUtil.filter({ \"a\", \"b\", \"a\" }, function(v) return v == \"a\" end) However, this isn’t advised and typically considered bad practice. It’s better to keep variables as local as possible and avoid global variables as much as possible in order to prevent accidentally using or overriding variables from other files. When you use require with this extension the files you require are searched for in the workspace directory. So when you opened a directory and want to require a file lib.TableUtil, you’d need this kind of directory structure: workspace directory └── lib └── TableUtil.lua When you workspace directory doesn’t contain the files you want to require directly, but in a subdirectory, you can adjust the include path setting. This defines a relative path from the workspace directory that is used as the root directory to find files. E.g. setting it to src would change you directory structure to: workspace directory └── src └── lib └── TableUtil.lua The files can alternatively also have the ending .ttslua instead of .lua if you prefer that. Splitting and bundling XML UI files is also possible. This can be done by using a special element called Include. It has one attribute called src that defines the path to the file you want to include in the XML. Unlike require for Lua files, you need to use a / to separate directories. E.g. the following XML would look for a file called TurnUi.xml inside the game directory from your workspace directory: Bundling XML files also takes into account the setting mentioned in the previous section, to define to root path to look for. However, there’s one big difference compared to Lua when using in files that are included from another file. In require you always have to define the complete path to a file from the root path. In XML however, is resolved from the path where the file is located at. E.g. consider this directory structure: workspace directory ├── lib │ ├── CoolPanel.xml │ └── TableUtil.lua └── game ├── GameController.lua ├── PlayerController.lua ├── TurnButton.xml └── TurnUi.xml In Lua, you’d have to use the complete path to each file: -- Global require(\"game.GameController\") -- game.GameController require(\"lib.TableUtil\") require(\"game.PlayerController\") In XML, after resolving the game/TurnUi.xml from the root path, the inside TurnUi.xml are resolved from its own path: So TurnButton.xml can be included with simply src=\"TurnButton\" (as it’s in the same directory. But since CoolPanel.xml is in a sibling directory, you’d first have to \"navigate\" there. You can use .. to navigate up in the directory tree. When the extension reads the scripts from TTS it reverses the bundling step and only writes the reduced script to the script file of an object. When using \"Save and Play\" the bundling is performed again und the scripts are updated from the files on your local filesystem. This is great when working on mods where you are the author or have access to the original source files. However, when looking at the script of other mods (e.g. to find out how things are done, add a feature for yourself, etc.), this isn’t helpful as you wouldn’t be easily able to use \"Save and Play\" again since you don’t have the files that are used to require (or ). This is why the extension also keeps a copy of the bundled script in a separate bundled directory in the output directory. This is the \"raw\" version of the script as it is in TTS itself, left untouched. You can look at the script and even edit it. Then instead of using the regular \"Save and Play\" command, there’s also a \"Save and Play (Bundled)\" command. This will send the scripts that are in the bundled directory instead of the regular ones. No further bundling or processing will happen, the scripts will be sent as is. This allows to work with mods where the original sources are not available. It’s not as comfortable as using bundling though, e.g. if there’s a bug in some required file that is used on multiple objects, you’d have to again fix that on every object instead of only one file. TTS itself only supports one script file per object. It doesn’t offer any support for loading scripts from different files. So what the extension does is to combine all the split files into one script file again and sent the combined file to TTS. It also transforms the script a bit to mimic the behavior of the actual require function from Lua. This also ensures that each required file is only loaded once, even if multiple instance of require for the same are used. To get an idea of what happens during bundling, this is a simplified version of the result. local bundles = {} local loadedBundles = {} local require = function(name) if not loadedBundles[name] then loadedBundles[name] = bundles[name]() end return loadedBundles[name] end bundles[\"lib.TableUtil\"] = function() local TableUtil = {} function TableUtil.filter(tab, predicate) -- the code from the example before end return TableUtil end bundles[\"root\"] = function() local TableUtil = require(\"lib.TableUtil\") TableUtil.filter({ \"a\", \"b\", \"a\" }, function(v) return v == \"a\" end) end require(\"root\") Each file that is require is put into a table and wrapped around a function. The first time require is called for a file, this function is executed and the result will be put into another table. Now, every subsequent require for the same file will simply load this result instead of executing the function again. The actual result adds some more code, e.g. for error handling and special cases, but this simple example should give a good idea of what is happening.","title":"Bundling","component":"editor","version":"1","name":"bundling","url":"/editor/latest/bundling.html","titles":[{"text":"Setting the correct lookup path","hash":"_setting_the_correct_lookup_path","id":1},{"text":"Bundling XML UI","hash":"_bundling_xml_ui","id":2},{"text":"Working with bundled scripts","hash":"save-and-play","id":3},{"text":"How does it work exactly?","hash":"_how_does_it_work_exactly","id":4}]},"7":{"id":7,"text":"Commands that are used for objects can also be executed without an object context, e.g. from the command palette in VS Code.

The concatenation is done by the order of selections, not by the order of the text in the text document. Macro functions are a feature to interact between the Lua code you want to execute and the VS Code instance where the extension is running at. E.g. you can trigger a selection dialog in VS Code where you select an object from the currently available objects on the table. Or open some text directly as an editor in VS Code instead of printing it into the output channel. This allows to write helper template files that can be more easily re-used without adjusting the template itself (e.g. by replacing the GUID of the object your want to with). In fact, many of the extension features are implemented using macro functions, e.g. locating an object or getting the runtime UI. More macros will also be added in the future. If you have an idea of a macro that might benefit you, let me know. Macros functions are only enabled when this setting is enabled (which it is by default). However, this setting can be disabled when working with unknown or untrusted mods to prevent accidentally triggering. This macro lets you trigger a selection dialog inside VS Code that shows all currently loaded objects. It takes two arguments: An option table to configure the shown selection (see below). A callback function that is executed once the selection was done in VS Code. The callback receives the object reference of the selected object as it’s only parameter. The object reference can also be Global, when configured through the options. Example __object__({ placeholder = \"Select an object to locate it\" }, function(obj) -- executed after the selection was done in TTS -- obj is now the object reference of the selected object print(obj.getName()) end) This example will trigger a selection dialog like this in VS Code. Selecting one of the objects will trigger the provided callback function in TTS with the object reference of the selected object. When the object is already destroyed after selecting it, an error message is thrown instead. When the selection is cancelled in VS Code, the callback isn’t called. The following fields can be set in the options table to adjust which objects are selectable and ho how the prompt will look like: Table 1.

Example sendExternalMessage({ type = \"write\", content = \"Hello World\", name = \"Test.txt\", }) This will write a file called Test.txt with this content: Hello World Example sendExternalMessage({ type = \"write\", content = '{ \"this\": { \"is\": \"json\" } }', object = \"-1\", name = \"test.txt\" }) This will write a file called Global.test.txt inside the output directory with the content formatted as: { \"this\": { \"is\": \"json\" } } Example Files can not be written outside the workspace directory (e.g. by using a name like ../../test.txt). Writing a file will be ignored, if the resolved file path is not inside the workspace directory. Those messages can be handled with the onExternalMessage event inside TTS. Each message has type field to distinguish them and fields specific to the message. Example function onExternalMessage(message) if message.type == \"object\" then -- do things with the message end end This message is sent as a response to the Request object message after a selection in VS Code was made. If the selection was cancelled, no message is sent. Table 3. Fields Name Type Usage type \"object\" Used to distinguish different messages. guid string The GUID of the object that was requested. Will be -1 for Global. Example function onExternalMessage(message) if message.type == \"object\" then local object if message.guid == \"-1\" then object = Global else object = getObjectFromGUID(message.guid) end print(object.UI.getXML()) end end","title":"Custom Messages","component":"editor","version":"1","name":"messages","url":"/editor/latest/messages.html","titles":[{"text":"Messages from TTS to the extension","hash":"_messages_from_tts_to_the_extension","id":1},{"text":"Request object message","hash":"request-object","id":2},{"text":"Write content message","hash":"_write_content_message","id":3},{"text":"Messages from the extension to TTS","hash":"_messages_from_the_extension_to_tts","id":4},{"text":"Object message","hash":"object-message","id":5}]},"11":{"id":11,"text":"The extension uses the following settings: Name Type Default Usage ttsEditor.includePath string src Relative path inside the workspace directory that is used to resolve modules and xml files (see Bundling). ttsEditor.enableMessages boolean true When set, custom messages sent from TTS are handled.

This is called the workspace directory in this documentation. If you are using a multi-directory workspace (by opening multiple root directories at once in VS Code), only the very first directory will be considered as the workspace directory. The so-called output directory is a special directory inside the workspace directory. This is where the extension will keep the files it read from TTS to work with. The output directory is a directory called .tts inside the workspace directory. The extension will write the script files from TTS to this directory for each object. You can navigate this directory directly, or use the TTS Objects View in the explorer window to get a cleaner view of the objects with more functionalities. Edit the scripts for the objects you want (either by opening from the output directory or the object view) and save the files. Then execute the command \"Save and Play\". The default keybinding for this command is kbd:ctrl[alt+s]. You can bind it to any other keys you like, through the settings in VS Code. Alternatively, there’s also a three dot menu button in the object view, where you can execute the command from. Using \"Save and Play\" will send all script files that are currently in your output directory back to TTS to update them on their respective objects. When a file was deleted in the output directory, the script will be removed from the object. When a file was added (e.g. adding an XML UI file), it will also be added to the object in TTS. \"Save and Play\" will load the save you loaded in TTS before applying scripts. This means, every change you performed after loading the save in TTS will be reverted, like adding new objects, moving objects, deleting objects, etc. So whenever you make physical changes in your loaded save file, first save it and load it right again, before using \"Save and Play\". Otherwise, you will lose the changes. While using \"Save and Play\" scripts on objects that use require and XML UI that uses will be updated by reading the latest version of those scripts from the file system. Checkout the bundling documentation for details about that process. Using the right-click context menu Scripting Scripting Edtior on an object in TTS, will create a Lua script in the output directory of the extension and open the newly created file. You can execute Lua scripts that you have opened in VS Code via the \"Execute Code\" command. Checkout the documentation for details.

Each object (and Global) has their own entry. Global will always be at the top and other objects will follow alphabetically by their name. Each entry also has an icon that indicates what type of object it is. Expanding an entry will show all the file that are available for this object. Clicking a file entry will open it in VS Code as it would open files from the regular explorer view. Hovering over an entry will show additional actions that can be performed on the object or file. Right-clicking an object shows even more actions. The buttons in the top bar of the view also offer some of the commands (e.g. \"Save and Play\") of the extension as menus. A reference for what each command does is documented here. This is how the view would look in action.
